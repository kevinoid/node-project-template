A Node.js/npm project template with [codecov](https://codecov.io/),
[coveralls](https://coveralls.io/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/),
[conventional-changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-cli),
[c8](https://github.com/bcoe/c8), [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/), and
[mocha](https://mochajs.org/).

It is the template that I am using for my own Node.js projects, which
represents my current preferences.  I am not advocating for these choices nor
this template specifically, although I am happy to discuss or explain any
choices made herein.  It is being published both for my own convenience and
in case it may be useful to others with similar tastes.
